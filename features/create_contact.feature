  I want the contacts I created via EPP synced to Registry

  Background:

  Scenario: Successfully sync contact
    Given partner creates a new contact via EPP
    When  system syncs latest created contacts

      | incomplete fields                   | bad request           |
      | empty request                       | bad request           |
